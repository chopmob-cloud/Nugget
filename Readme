This is a comprehensive report of Algorand Wallets and the mistaken distribution of tokens on the 16th Jan 2026.

This highlights the actors involved and what the users did with the tokens even after asking all other members of the community to simply return the tokens.

The project as a whole, has suffered due to the mistake in the first instance and also the actions of users/holders after they did not respond or return the tokens to the wallet they were issued from.

People can make up there own mind. For me I am truly saddened by people's actions - as a private individual. I take responsibility for my actions and any data that is made public.

All API access is via API public services and the data is freely available.
