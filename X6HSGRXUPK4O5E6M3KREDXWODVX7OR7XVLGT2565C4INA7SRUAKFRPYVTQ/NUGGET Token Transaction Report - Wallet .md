## Key Observations

### Part of Batch Distribution
This wallet received NUGGET just **106 seconds (1.8 minutes)** before Wallet 4:

| Wallet | Time | Amount | Difference |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|
| **This Wallet (X6HSG...)** | 16:40:35 UTC | 100,000,000 | Baseline |
| Wallet 4 (MNRLT...) | 16:42:41 UTC | 100,000,047 | +106 sec, +47 NUGGET |

### Same Smart Contract
- **Application ID:** 2650568591
- **Contract Address:** `ZLMXPKLRYPF6MT3VCI5JRTOG6ADFIWBL5D4MGYYYLKHGW6E333K4P4WTVM`
- **Caller:** `53LJLQATA34TUZRWPYQJXGRDDZIW4T3MXEQ455VFTASI5PSWXMBNN2R424`

### Round Number
Unlike Wallet 4 which received 100,000,047, this wallet received exactly **100,000,000** - a perfect round number. This suggests:
- Different distribution tier
- Base amount (Wallet 4 got base + 47 bonus)
- Earlier in distribution sequence

### Identical Pattern
1. ✅ Opt-in within seconds before distribution
2. ✅ Same smart contract (App 2650568591)
3. ✅ Same 26-second delay from opt-in to receipt
4. ✅ 100% balance retained
5. ✅ No subsequent transactions
